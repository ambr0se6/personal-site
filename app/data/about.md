#### Intro
I am an extroverted person who loves both the creative and technical sides of life. I am currenty a Software Developer at [X2O_Media](https://www.x2omedia.com/).
<br>
I love trying new things, helping others, and being on teams. I am particularly interested in education, inclusivity, public health, and design. I enjoy helping others do just about anything as well as volunteering.
<br><br>
#### Currently
As a recent university graduate I am trying to find out where I belong in this large world we all live in. I have chosen to follow my degree and become a Software Developer as of right now. When I am not working, I am writing, cooking, or playing Ultimate Frisbee.

#### Some History

- My parents are incredibly different and their differences helped define me as person. My father was a drummer for 25 years and is now a sound engineer. My mother worked in the marketing industry and is now taking all of her experience and starting her own consulting business (nobody who works harder or more passionately than her). 

- Because of these differing backgrounds I was raised to be (O P E N - M I N D E D). This made it difficult to figure out how to harness my equal parts of creativity and technical interest.

- My first memory of using a computer was when I was 7 in the UK playing Carmen Sandiego on the all-in-one Macintosh Desktops. (mine was sky blue and beautiful)

- At 11, I got married and divorced within 6 months (having a british accent in 5th grade proved dramatic). I also realized that I was not very tall so Basketball and Baseball did not make sense as career options. I took this as a sign to figure out what I was good at; this is when I fell in love with math.

- At 13, I joined a First Robotics Team [CougarTech](http://www.hflrobotics.com/) thanks to my best friend's brother dragging us to meetings. Learning to build, program, work with others and love healthy competition all became foundational elements of a lot future interests.

- At 15, I moved high schools and became an I.T. assistant for my high school which is when I learned about linux, the terminal, and how to build a computer. I gravitated towards controlling the computer through the terminal versus the actual architecture of the system. I also finally discovered the only sport I excelled at, Ultimate Frisbee. I started my own team a month later.

- At 16 & 17, the Robotics Team I was on [Windham_Windup](http://www.team3467.org/)competed at the National Championship level and I fell in love with Java programming throughout the entire experience of designing, creating, and competing with our robots (named Skip-5 and Wingman)

- At 18, I figured out the importance of networking and began attending technical conferences in Montreal as well as introducing myself to as many people as I could meet. I created my first personal website, web-scraper and I met my 2 best friends. Also, my passion for cooking exploded like a california wildfire.

- At 21, both academically and socially I had the best year of my life. I took super interesting courses in Machine Learning and Software Engineering Design. I was living in a 6 person loft with 5 other incredible human beings who I lucky to have within my inner circle today. I also became the McGill Ultimate Frisbee President, which was a blast!

- At 22, I graduated from [McGill_University](https://www.mcgill.ca) and then worked for McGill as a contractor until I got hired by [X2O_Media](https://www.x2omedia.com/). I currently live with an amazing roommate (weirdly we share a birthday (he's older by 4 hours)), in an amazing apartment, in the lively city of Montreal.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
